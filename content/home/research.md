  - title: "Risk for Price: Using Generalized Demand System for Asset Pricing"
    desc1: "Abstract: I construct a pricing kernel with consumption prices and expenditure by decomposing consumer's marginal utility. This pricing kernel explains variation of expected returns across equity portfolios. Consumption-CAPM works when detailed prices are included. "

  - title: "Intangible Capital around the World (joint with Juliana Salomao, Frederico Belo, Maria Ana Vitorino)"
    desc1: "Abstract:  We estimate the structural Q-theory model with both physical capital and intangible capital in each major equity market. The contribution of intangible capital to the firm’s market value is large across markets. Geographical variation of intangible capital adjustment cost is larger than that of physical capital. "

  - title: "Risk Exposure and Risk Premium of Necessity Price"
    desc1: "Abstract: Expected return is large for an equity portfolio where cash flow has strong negative correlation to price of necessity goods. This paper uses a quantitative model to explain the propagation of capital-augmenting productivity shock in consumption price and labor share in a multi-sector economy with limited stock market participation.
